# DELI-cious Sandwich Ordering App

*DELI-cious* is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to build their own sandwiches or choose from a selection of signature sandwiches. Users can also add drinks, chips, and sides to their order. When they're done, the app generates a receipt with their complete order summary and total price.

## Technologies

- *Java 17 (or above)*
- *No external dependencies* â€“ uses only standard Java libraries.

## Notes

- The application uses simple console input/output, so it should work on most console environments.
- In some terminals, the "clear screen" method may not fully clear the console, depending on your environment.
- The receipts are saved in the /resources/receipts directory with the date and time as the filename.
