Thanks for uploading your .tar file! I‚Äôll extract and review the contents for any Java code files to provide feedback. One moment while I take a look.

Your .tar archive contains several Java source files organized in a structured package layout. I'll begin the code review with a focus on class design, cohesion, and separation of concerns, especially between UI and business logic. Let's start by looking at the Main.java file and UserInterface.java‚Äîthese often serve as entry points and are critical for understanding how the logic flows.

Thanks for your patience! Here's the initial review of your Main.java and UserInterface.java files:

‚úÖ What's Working Well
Separation of Concerns Initiated: You've started to separate the main entry point (Main.java) from the user interface (UserInterface.java), which aligns with best practices from your course.

Use of Utility Classes: Calling Utility.printTitle() and Utility.loadingMessage() indicates you're leveraging helper methods to keep your UI cleaner.

üîç Suggestions for Improvement
1. Tight Coupling Between UI and Business Logic
   The UserInterface class directly constructs and manages the Order object. This means your UI layer is tightly coupled with the business logic. According to the object-oriented practices taught in the course (see Workbook 4 and Workbook 6), the UI should delegate rather than control the business model.

Recommendation:
Move Order-related logic to a separate controller or service class. Then the UI can simply call orderController.startOrder() or similar.

2. Use of Scanner as Public Field
   java
   Copy code
   public Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
   Making Scanner a public field is not a good practice. It exposes internal implementation details.

Recommendation:
Make it private final and provide controlled access if needed.

3. Direct Input Handling in UI
   You're reading user input (input.nextInt() etc.) directly inside logic-heavy methods like displayOrderScreen(). This makes it harder to test.

Recommendation:
Refactor user input into smaller helper methods. This increases testability and readability.
